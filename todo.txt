Main site stuff:
1. I want to have the metronome and tuner have some sort of lock,  using a global "string" passed by pointer or ref or whateve to the classes.
so that only one can be used at a time, and if metronome is going 
and you try to use tuner then it doesn't work, but maybe this is unneccesary
4. Make all variables, classes, and functions follow the same naming scheme
5. Put doc strings on everyfunction and class,
6. Put headers on each file


1. Tuner:
Visualizer



Metronome:

2. Metronome interface: 
polyrhythm button, make the generateBar popout another list, volume input/turn on or off each beat

3. metronome Visualizer, we will call request animatonUpdate on some function, 
and based on the time from this.lastNote and .currentTime, and bpm, and a static variable to keep track of wheteher its swinging left or right, we can show a simple metronome bar
sweeping across the screen.

Note the function must check if this.playing, and lol we could make it so there are two overlaid for the polyrhythms

rhythmTracker:
1. button for bpm entry
2. needs sensitivity button


Harry todo:

pitch up first tick
polyrthythm button
be able to set bpm
