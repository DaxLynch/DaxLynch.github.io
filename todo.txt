Main site stuff:
1. I want to have the metronome and tuner have some sort of lock,  using a global "string" passed by pointer or ref or whateve to the classes.
so that only one can be used at a time, and if metronome is going 
and you try to use tuner then it doesn't work, but maybe this is unneccesary
2. Maybe some css?
4. Make all variables, classes, and functions follow the same naming scheme
5. Put doc strings on everyfunction and class,
6. Put headers on each file


1. Tuner:
Visualizer



Metronome:
1. Make playNote handle Polyrhyythms, so have a class variable for if pr's are playing,
make a variable for the sounds played on each beat, (soundSelection function or whateve will
change this), make another variable for loudness of each beat, maybe gonna need two of theses,
one for each pr.
so for a 3/4 and 4/4 polyrhytm, the first this.notePeriod will be .25 of a bar, then the next notePeriod will be .3333 - .25 (because thats how much time is inbetween the two notes.) There should be some easy formula for calulating this. I.e at step one calculate 

2. Metronome interface: 
bpm input, polyrhythm button, make the generateBar popout another list, volume input,

3. metronome Visualizer, we will call request animatonUpdate on some function, 
and based on the time from this.lastNote and .currentTime, and bpm, and a static variable to keep track of wheteher its swinging left or right, we can show a simple metronome bar
sweeping across the screen.

Note the function must check if this.playing, and lol we could make it so there are two overlaid for the polyrhythms

rhythmTracker:
1. button for bpm entry
2. needs sensitivity button


Harry todo:

pitch up first tick
polyrthythm button/functionality
be able to set bpm

style html and css to look good.
